 Public API Request - Treehouse - Project 5

In this project, A JSON API was used to build the app directory for a start-up company. 
In this app,the directory displays 12 users from the Random User API. Contact information displays for each user. For each contact, there is a photo, name, email, city and state. When the user clicks on a specific employee, a pop-up, or modal will appear displaying more information about that particular employee.

I added some CSS changes including background color, font change, a hover effect when the user hovers on each random user.
